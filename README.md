# offline-bookmarks-page
Simple static offline home page for browser with shortcuts

## Motivation
I want to create own static page for browser bookmarks, same look per browser.
For me it optimize space usage for links and disable browsers to force
new changes. And I have same bookmarks on chrome and firefox as well.

## TODO
Will be refactored to React and webpack or static html with ES6 core
